### Hi everybody! 

- My name is Caleb Penning, pronouns: (he/him)
- I'm an early career Software Engineer from the SF Bay Area.
- Right now I am finishing up the Software Engineering Career Track at Springboard. 
- I am currently working with React, React-Router and Redux quite a bit.
- I'm hoping to land my first developer position by the year's end. 
- I am pretty open to front end, back end, and full stack work but if you made me pick, I'd probably go back end with Node.js or Python.
- After I finish my course at Springboard, I plan on learning some Solidity programming, and eventually I'd love to pick up C# and Unity.
- Ask me about my cats, music, movies, food, and pretty much anything else :) (even the older, sillier code on here)

#### Cheers!
