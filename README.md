## Hi everybody!

---

- My name is Caleb Penning.
- I'm a Software Engineer from the SF Bay Area, specializing in Fullstack Web Development.
- Primarily, I do work in React, Svelte and Node. I am front end focused in my current role, but also love spinning up web servers and web APIs, CLI tools, working with Databases, and scripting. 
- Current projects I'm working on include a Discord bot to help automate a "Gaming Book Club" I have going with some pals, and my personal site (major WIP).
- For learning, I'm dipping my toes into the OWASP top ten to try and be a more secure developer, and have been slowly trying to pick up Unity. 
- Hoping to do more back-end oriented work in the future, would be happiest in a full-stack role.

### Cheers!
